= tick

A Clojure(Script) library for dealing with time. Intended as a
replacement for clj-time.

Based on Java 8 time (on the JVM) and js-joda (on JavaScript
runtimes). We are considering an implementation based on https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal[Temporal], via
https://github.com/henryw374/tempo[Tempo] when it is available.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[tick.core :as t])

;; Get the current time
(t/now)
----

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFuL-ZDoB2U[Henry Widd's talk at Clojure/North 2019] for some background

== Top tips 

=== java.time

In both Clojure and Clojurescript versions, tick is just calling through to java.time methods. Understanding https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/overview.html[the main entities of java.time] is necessary to use tick. For example, one should know that there are 2 separate ways to measure amounts of time, 3 ways to represent a point on the timeline and so on.

=== Instants 

Instants are not 'calendar-aware' - they just contain millis/nanos field representing an 
offset from the Unix epoch. This means Instants have no method to get their year or month for example, 
because to do so would require a calendar (e.g. the Gregorian calendar).

Tick provides some help with this when accessing properties of an Instant though. For example
`(t/year (t/now))` works. To make that possible, tick first converts the Instant into a ZonedDateTime 
(which does have a calendar). Take note however that the zone of the ZonedDateTime will be the 
browser's or jvm's timezone. To be explicit about the zone required do this:  

[source,clojure]
----
(-> (t/now)
    (t/in "UTC")
    t/year)
----

The other cases where calendar-awareness might come up is when formatting Instants to string or when
shifting them by e.g. years/months, so Tick 
https://widdindustries.com/why-not-interop/[shows explanatory error messages in that case].

=== Singular vs Plural ?

As with java.time, any functions working with amounts of time (ie Durations or Periods), 
will have names which are in the plural. Functions that
work with dates and times are singular. Knowing that, e.g. `t/second` vs `t/seconds` 
makes sense.

== Status

* tick.core - stable
* tick.alpha.interval - Alpha: Ready to use with the caveat that the API might still undergo
minor changes.

== Install

Get the latest from https://clojars.org/tick[Clojars] and
add to your `project.clj`, `build.boot` or `deps.edn`.

To use this from Clojurescript, you must have at least version 1.11.51. If using shadow-cljs, it must be at least version 2.19.3

For Clojurescript users of Tick, see https://github.com/juxt/tick/blob/master/docs/cljs.adoc[docs/cljs.adoc], for
some discussion around Clojurescript build size.

Here is a one-liner to drop into a node repl with tick:

----
clj -Sdeps '{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "RELEASE" } tick/tick {:mvn/version "RELEASE"} }}' -m cljs.main  -re node  --repl
----

== Development

=== Develop The Documentation Site

Build the html
----
make
----

Build the CLJS and start a figwheel repl+server
----
make dev-docs-cljs
----

Navigate to localhost:9500 in your browser

=== Build a production version of the Documentation Site

----
make release-docs-cljs
----

=== Develop Tick

Jack in with cider or equivalent method in other IDEs, and start the cljs build with:

----
(figwheel-start!)
----


And when you get a REPL you can run all the JVM tests with

----
(test-clj)
----

Or outside of the REPL run:

----
make test-all
----

which will run clojure and clojurescript (chrome) tests.
tests are running with https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[Kaocha] 

As long as you have you have started your repl with these aliases "-A:test-cljs:test-clj", you can also run backend clojure tests in the repl with something like

----
(require '[kaocha.repl :as kr])
(kr/run :clj)
----

==== Setting `CHROME_BIN`

If you get an error similar to the following:

----
No binary for ChromeHeadless browser on your platform.
----

Set the environment variable `CHROME_BIN` to wherever Chrome or Chromium is installed on your platform.


=== Release

create a git tag.

`make install` (this installs in ~/.m2 - check that things look ok)

`make deploy`  - you need to have set up clojars credentials as per https://github.com/applied-science/deps-library

`git push origin new-tag-name`

== Acknowledgements

In particular, special credit to Eric Evans for discovering Allen's
interval algebra and pointing out its potential usefulness,
demonstrating a working implementation of Allen's ideas in
link:https://github.com/domainlanguage/time-count[his Clojure library].

Thanks also to my esteemed colleagues Patrik Kårlin for his redesign of
the interval constructor function, and Henry Widd for porting to cljc.
